## About Me

-   Professor of Urban Analytics in the [Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/), University College London
-   Just stood down after 5-years of being Head of Department for CASA
    -   Arrived as post-doc in 2010
    -   Grown to 18 full-time academics (3 in 2010!)
    -   150 Masters Students across 2 MSc Programmes
    -   20-odd PhD students
-   Lifetime geographer - although didn't ever really have any plans to be, it just sort of happened!

## What am I going to talk about today?

-   A little bit of background on the important (and often overlooked) part that residential buildings play in our journey towards a carbon net-zero country.

-   The leaky homes problem we have in the UK

-   How we can measure leaky homes - Energy Performance Certificates

-   What needs to be done to fix leaky homes and the problems ahead

-   Overview of findings from recent Frontiers in Sustainability paper which looks at national variations in energy efficiency by property, neighbourhood and local authority type.

-   Background on the transport sector, inequalities and the role of models in transport planning and net-zero ambitions.

-   Introduction to activity-based models and how they might offer new perspectives which might assist the transition to net-zero

-   Some ongoing research in the preliminary stages which is going to leverage activity-based models

-   Observations and conclusions

## UK CO^2^ Emissions

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The UK Government has legally binding targets under the Climate Change Act 2008 to reach 'net zero' carbon emissions by 2050

-   Carbon emissions are produced through demand for energy

    -   **directly** through burning gas, wood, coal, peat, oil for heat/cooking etc. in buildings and through petrol and diesel combustion in vehicles, kerosene combustion in flights as well as other uses in agriculture and industry
    -   **indirectly** through burning these things to produce electricity

-   **Residential buildings** currently account for about **13.7%** of the UK's total greenhouse gas emissions - heating, cooling + running applicances.

-   **Domestic Transport** currently accounts for almost **28%** of total greenhouse gas emissions

-   While total Greenhouse Gas emissions have reduced since 1990, housing and transport are now responsible for a greater proportion of this total than ever before (up from 25% to almost 42%) - and still produce around **169 million tons of CO^2^** **per year**

-   Housing in the UK is some of the worst, overall, in Europe for emitting greenhouse gases.

-   Even after adjusting for population, UK housing stock is responsible for emitting far more CO^2^ than housing in countries with much colder climates like Iceland, Sweden, Norway and Finland

## Leaky Homes

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   In 2021, the National Housing Federation reported that a combination of gas central heating and poor insulation meant that as heat easily leaks from many of the UK's homes, it requires even more gas to heat them.

-   The average family or household in England is currently producing more CO^2^ every year by just living in their home than they are by driving their car!

-   Three in every five (60%) homeowners don't think their home energy use has much of an impact on carbon emissions. More than one in four homeowners (28%) have no plans to make "eco-upgrades" to their homes in the next ten years.

## The UK Housing Stock

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   UK Housing Stock is incredibly diverse in terms of its morphology and most of it is OLD
-   Age is relevant as insulation standards are only a relatively recent innovation and there is a conspicuous absence of a national programme of retrofitting to improve old stock

## How do we know how leaky our home is?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Energy Performance Certificates were introduced in England and Wales in August 2007
-   A valid certificate (they last for 10 years) is now required for any property sold or rented in the UK
-   Every property gets a current rating - A to G - alongside a potential rating, which relates to what it could achieve with better insulation, double glazing, etc.
-   EPCs are created by surveyors who use something called the 'Standard Assessment Procedure' (SAP) to rate the building. SAP accounts for things like:
    -   Size of building
    -   Age of Building
    -   Building materials used
    -   Glazing
    -   Heating and hot water type
    -   Type of lighting
-   The SAP is an imperfect science and prone to human error, but it's the best method currently available

## What does the government want?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   80% of the homes we will be living in in 2050 are already built now, so we need to focus on improving the housing stock we already have
-   The Clean Growth Strategy was published in October 2017 and includes several targets to improve energy efficiency:
    -   to upgrade all fuel poor homes to Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) **band C** by 2030;
    -   to upgrade as many homes as possible to EPC **band C** by 2035

But is this enough and how are they going to achieve it?

## Making homes more energy efficient + additional benefits & challenges

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   'Retrofitting' -\> process of improving:
    -   insulation
    -   ventilation
    -   air-tightness
-   upgrading
    -   heating (e.g. to heat-pumps)
    -   lighting (LED bulbs)
    -   installing smart thermostat and heat control devices
    -   installing solar panels
-   Any one could improve energy efficiency, but doing all at once is known as 'Deep Retrofit.'

## Making homes more energy efficient + additional benefits & challenges

-   Retrofitting has other benefits:
    -   **Health** - The Building Research Establishment [estimates that poor housing costs the NHS £1.4bn per year in additional treatments](https://bregroup.com/news-insights/the-cost-of-poor-housing-to-the-nhs/), with excess cold causing the most problems.
    -   **Jobs** - National retrofit programme could create thousands of jobs, benefiting the wider economy;
    -   **Energy security** - making us less reliant on imported fossil gas for heating
-   But, retrofitting is expensive (up-front cost) - [recent estimates](https://residential.jll.co.uk/insights/research/decarbonising-uk-housing-2024) are that the average cost of retrofitting a property to Grade C or above would cost ***£35,000*** - even basic insulation costs can run into many thousands of pounds.
-   Saving money on heating will eventually make this money back, but it could take many years

## What needs to be done?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Insulate Britain - pressure group - Estimates that 1.5 homes per minute need to be retrofitted up until 2050 to hit our legally-binding net-zero target - something that we are currently far from achieving.
-   Retrofit is expensive
-   Route retrofit unclear for many people (where should I start, who can do it for me?)
-   Central government needs to develop proper incentives
    -   Direct funding (grants)
    -   or tax incentives
-   Schemes such as those available in Ireland (where government recommends suppliers, installers etc.) needed to help people get started
-   Insulate Britain highlights that UK government currently doesn't have a long-term strategy or funding mechanism in place to upgrade/retrofit homes to meet our climate commitments

## How can we get there?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Understanding the various dimensions (scale, location, social etc.) of the housing energy efficiency challenge is crucial to effective strategy and planning.

    -   Which housing / owners should be targeted first to accelerate the transition?

-   Paper in Frontiers in Sustainability (and related working paper) a first effort to define the parameters of the problem
